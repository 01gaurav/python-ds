# Python Data Structures

This repository contains data structures and algorithms questions in Python. 

## Objective

The open source community has helped me a lot during my interview preparations and studies while I was in my undergrad. I always wanted to give something back to the community. In my endeavour to contribute something back, I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Python in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch :)

## Structure of the repository

As of now, the repository contains 2 main directories (data_structures and algorithms) and a file called `useful_links.txt` - 

1. Data Structures  - This folder contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.
    1.1. Array  
    1.2. Binary Search Tree  
    1.3. Linked List  
    1.4. Stack  
    1.5. Graphs  
    1.6. Circular Linked List  

2. Algorithms - Contains algorithm based questions like dynamic programming, greedy etc.

## Things need to be done

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

1. Queue questions
2. Algorithms  
    2.1. Dynamic Programming  
    2.2. Greedy   
3. More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, tries, heaps and hash.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcomed :)

Here are some guidelines -

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Make the new branch and name it accordingly
3. File the PR and wait for the review :)
